# README for Starred Courses Plugin
developed by Andy Zito at Lafayette College
version: 0.1 2018-07-02

## Installation:

Unzip files into your Moodle blocks directory. This will create a folder called starred_courses.

Go to the admin Notifications page to complete installation.

## Use:

By default the plugin will add a "Star this course" link to the course navigation menu. This can be disabled in the settings.

// TODO The recommended way to view starred courses is to install the [Filtered Course List block](https://moodle.org/plugins/block_filtered_course_list), and use the "starred" filter.

Alternatively, you may feel free to use the provided `lib.php` functions to code your own block or other method of display.
